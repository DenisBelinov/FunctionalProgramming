-- -- EXERCISE: Fold "iterative"
-- -- foldl (+) 0 [1..100] -- 5050
-- -- foldl (-) 15 [1..5] -- 0
-- foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- foldl _ nv [] = nv

-- EXERCISE: Inserting into an ordered list
-- EXAMPLES:
-- insert 5 [1,7,10] -- [1,5,7,10]
-- insert 1337 [1,7,10] -- [1,7,10,1337]

-- EXERCISE: Merge sort
-- Sort a list by taking advantage of the following:
-- 0. We can trivially sort a list with zero or one elements
-- 1. If we split a list in in half, and sort those two halves,
--    then we can use merge to create a new sorted list

-- EXERCISE: Partitioning lists
-- Partition a list according to some predicate.
-- The resulting pair has the elements which satisfy the predicate as its first element,
-- and those that don't as its second element.
-- EXAMPLES:
-- partition even [1..10] -- ([2,4,6,8,10],[1,3,5,7,9])
-- partition (<5) [10,9..0] -- ([4,3,2,1,0],[10,9,8,7,6,5])

-- EXERCISE: Quicksort
-- Sort a list by taking advantage of the following:
-- If we take a number from a list, let's say p, we sort those smaller than p and those larger than p
-- and then we append these three in that order we will get a sorted list.

-- EXERCISE: Taking from a list

-- EXERCISE: Taking from a list

-- dropWhile even [2,4,6,7,10,12] -- [7,10,12]
dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile = undefined

-- EXERCISE: Splitting a list
-- Split a string on a given character
-- Note that String in Haskell is simply [Char]
-- EXAMPLES:
-- splitOn 'a' "" -- []
-- splitOn 'a' "qwertya" --  ["qwerty"]
-- splitOn 'a' "aqwerty" -- ["","qwerty"]
-- splitOn 'a' "abracadabra" --  ["","br","c","d","br"]

-- EXERCISE: Grouping
-- Group the numbers which are next to each other and equal to each other
-- group [] -- []
-- group [1,1,1,2,3] -- [[1,1,1],[2],[3]]
-- group [1,1,1,2,3,1,3,3] -- [[1,1,1],[2],[3],[1],[3,3]]

-- EXERCISE: Faster primes
-- Implement this using the Sieve of Eratosthenes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
-- (found below as a task)
-- tl;dr:
-- We can get all the prime numbers using this idea:
-- We will walk through all the natural numbers
-- If we assume the current number n is prime then we can leave it on our list of primes
-- Afterwards we know that all numbers that n divides definitely aren't prime,
-- so we can filter those out from the rest of primes, and then recursively do this
-- procedure to get all prime numbers.
